This repository contains the definition and implementation of some data scructures and primitives used in Computational Geometry, such as Point, Segment (for a line segment) and the class with the primitives. This is not intended to be exhaustive.

The main purpose of this code is to demonstrate the Single Responsibility principle (by separating different functionalities to different methods or classes), the simple nature of dealing with some computational geometry primitives without having to use division and as reference for future use.
